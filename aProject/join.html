            <p>
                Our best reason for joining us is the efficiency we manage 
                to resolve the conflicts that a microbusiness merchant 
                normally faces; competition, advertising, quality, variety. 
                These are things that big brands can overcome, but small businesses 
                struggle every day, we help you set goals, provide support and create 
                a community based on experience that the merchant can take advantage of.
